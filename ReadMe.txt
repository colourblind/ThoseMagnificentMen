2D side-viewed multi-player single-keyboard dogfighting shenanigans!

Inspired by many happy hours playing a similar game with 4 people crowded round 
an Amiga.

Still very much a work in progress.

RUNNING THE GAME

ThoseMagnificentMen [numberOfHumanPlayers] [numberOfBots]

The total number of players (humans and bots) is capped at four, so you can't 
have 3 people and 3 bots - you'll end up with 3 people and 1 bot.
